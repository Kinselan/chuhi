=====

Chuhi is a Rails application aimed at intermediate and advanced learners of Japanese.
It combines spaced repetition with collaborative learning features to help you improve your Japanese
and encourage your friends to do the same.

Try it!
----
Currently hosting this application on [Heroku](http://chuhi.herokuapp.com).

Features
----
* Study words you enter using spaced repetition.

That's about it right now, but once the core study features are taken care of collaboration and courses will be the next to
be looked at. Like to see some mockups? Head on over to [moqup](https://moqups.com/rgravina/ZwN9rqPX).

Like to use the spaced repetition features in your own application? The core study features are being worked on in
the [okubo](https://github.com/rgravina/okubo) gem.

Thanks!

* Mitch Grace - for providing many of the great ideas that went into Chuhi.
