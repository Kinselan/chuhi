    %h2="About Chuhi"
    %p
      Chuhi is an application aimed at intermediate (Chu) and advanced (hi) learners of Japanese. It combines spaced repetition with collaborative learning features to help you improve your Japanese and encourage your peers to do the same.
    %h3="Who created Chuhi?"
    %p
      Chuhi was originally created by Robert Gravina (<a href="http://twitter.com/robertgravina", target="_chuhi">@robertgravina</a>) and Mitch Grace. We wanted a Japanese language learning application that was modern, collaborative and fun. We also wanted to contribute to the Japanense language learning community by providing content that was freely available for others to use.
